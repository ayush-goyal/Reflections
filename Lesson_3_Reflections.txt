When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would want to use a remote repository when you are working with other
    people or want to collaborate with other people online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Somebody else might be working on a project that you might not want
    on your computer until its done.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks happen only on GitHub when you don't have permission to change it.
    Clones are when you clone a GitHub repository onto your computer. Branches
    are when you want to do experiments and not effect the main code until its done.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So the computer knows whether you are ahead of the origin branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You could probably send an email. It would be hard beacause you don't know what
    exactly changed. It would be easier because you don't have to learn how to use git
    or GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
