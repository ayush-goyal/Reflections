How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It clearly showed which parts of the code had changed greatly making
    it easier to spot the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can look back to the code you've made and see all the ideas you've had.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pro are that it wont save every inute adn you wont have hundreds of copies.
    The con is that you might forget to save at a certain point.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    SOme files might not go together and some files do. In the case of Google Docs,
    It doesn't know which files go togther adn which files don't. Saving multiple
    files at once helps prevent you from saving each file seperately.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    They show you how certain parts of the files changed and when it happened.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It will always allow to revert back to your old code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Maybe trying to make an advanced program in python such as a calculator.
